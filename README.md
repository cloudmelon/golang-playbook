# Go learning playbook

Go has ability to combine the performance and type safety of venerable languages such as Java and C++ with near-instant compile time of scripting language such as Python and JavaScript. When you're working on developing a web service or web application ( build-in concurrency model and network API ) or even used it as a scripting language in the automation scenario, Golang is an excellent candidate. Go was born in Nov 2009, community is still on the way to explore and shape the future of Go as of today. You can also found Go is being used in some machine learning scripting or GUI light client dev scenarios.
